# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves creating a comprehensive Streamlit web application for environmental analysis focused on urban climate and sustainability metrics. The application will provide interactive analysis tools for temperature patterns, green space impact assessment, and building environmental impact evaluation. The system will process geospatial data and provide visualizations to help users understand environmental factors affecting urban areas.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As an environmental analyst, I want to analyze temperature patterns in urban areas, so that I can identify heat islands and climate trends.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses the temperature analysis page THEN the system SHALL display an interactive interface for temperature data analysis
2. WHEN a user uploads temperature data THEN the system SHALL process and validate the data format
3. WHEN temperature data is processed THEN the system SHALL generate visualizations showing temperature patterns and trends
4. WHEN analysis is complete THEN the system SHALL provide downloadable reports and charts
5. IF invalid data is uploaded THEN the system SHALL display clear error messages and data format requirements

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As an urban planner, I want to assess the impact of green spaces on local climate, so that I can make informed decisions about urban development.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses the green space impact page THEN the system SHALL provide tools for analyzing vegetation and climate correlation
2. WHEN geospatial data is uploaded THEN the system SHALL process both green space boundaries and climate measurements
3. WHEN analysis is performed THEN the system SHALL calculate and display the cooling effect of green spaces
4. WHEN results are generated THEN the system SHALL show before/after comparisons and impact metrics
5. IF insufficient data is provided THEN the system SHALL guide users on required data types and formats

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a sustainability consultant, I want to evaluate building environmental impact, so that I can recommend improvements for energy efficiency and environmental performance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses the building impact page THEN the system SHALL provide building assessment tools and metrics
2. WHEN building data is input THEN the system SHALL calculate environmental impact scores based on multiple factors
3. WHEN assessment is complete THEN the system SHALL display energy efficiency ratings and environmental metrics
4. WHEN recommendations are generated THEN the system SHALL provide actionable suggestions for improvement
5. IF building data is incomplete THEN the system SHALL highlight missing information and provide guidance

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a researcher, I want to access and process geospatial climate data, so that I can perform comprehensive environmental analysis.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL load and process the Kilimani LST prediction data file
2. WHEN geospatial data is accessed THEN the system SHALL provide proper coordinate system handling and projection
3. WHEN data processing occurs THEN the system SHALL maintain data integrity and provide processing status updates
4. WHEN analysis tools are used THEN the system SHALL support common geospatial operations and calculations
5. IF data files are corrupted or missing THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and recovery options

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As any user of the application, I want a consistent and intuitive interface, so that I can easily navigate between different analysis tools.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses the application THEN the system SHALL display a clear navigation menu with all available pages
2. WHEN navigating between pages THEN the system SHALL maintain consistent styling and layout
3. WHEN performing analysis THEN the system SHALL provide progress indicators and status updates
4. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL display user-friendly error messages with suggested actions
5. WHEN using the application THEN the system SHALL be responsive and work on different screen sizes
