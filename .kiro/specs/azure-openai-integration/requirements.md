# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves integrating Azure OpenAI capabilities into the existing Temperature Analysis page to provide sophisticated AI-powered analysis of Land Surface Temperature (LST) data. The enhancement will replace the current basic AI response system with Azure OpenAI's advanced language models to deliver more insightful, context-aware, and scientifically accurate analysis of temperature patterns, heat islands, and environmental conditions in the Kilimani area.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As an environmental analyst, I want to use Azure OpenAI for sophisticated temperature data analysis, so that I can get expert-level insights and recommendations about urban heat patterns.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the Temperature Analysis page loads THEN the system SHALL initialize an Azure OpenAI client connection
2. WHEN Azure OpenAI is successfully connected THEN the system SHALL display a connection status indicator
3. WHEN a user asks questions about temperature data THEN the system SHALL use Azure OpenAI to generate comprehensive, scientifically accurate responses
4. WHEN Azure OpenAI processes queries THEN the system SHALL provide context about the specific Kilimani LST data including statistics and patterns
5. IF Azure OpenAI connection fails THEN the system SHALL gracefully fallback to basic analysis responses

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to configure Azure OpenAI settings and analysis modes, so that I can customize the complexity and style of AI responses to match my expertise level.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL load Azure OpenAI configuration from environment variables
2. WHEN configuration is incomplete THEN the system SHALL display setup instructions and required environment variables
3. WHEN a user accesses analysis settings THEN the system SHALL provide options for different analysis modes (Technical, Comprehensive, Simple)
4. WHEN an analysis mode is selected THEN the system SHALL adjust AI response complexity and terminology accordingly
5. WHEN configuration changes are made THEN the system SHALL validate settings and update the AI client connection

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a researcher, I want Azure OpenAI to provide context-aware analysis of LST data, so that I can understand the environmental implications and get actionable recommendations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Azure OpenAI generates responses THEN the system SHALL include specific temperature statistics from the loaded Kilimani data
2. WHEN analyzing heat patterns THEN the system SHALL reference actual percentile values, temperature ranges, and spatial distributions
3. WHEN providing recommendations THEN the system SHALL suggest practical urban planning and environmental mitigation strategies
4. WHEN explaining technical concepts THEN the system SHALL adapt explanations based on the selected analysis mode
5. WHEN discussing environmental implications THEN the system SHALL provide scientifically accurate information about urban heat islands and climate effects

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper error handling and fallback mechanisms for Azure OpenAI integration, so that the application remains functional even when AI services are unavailable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Azure OpenAI API calls fail THEN the system SHALL catch exceptions and display appropriate error messages
2. WHEN API limits are exceeded THEN the system SHALL inform users about rate limiting and suggest retry timing
3. WHEN network connectivity issues occur THEN the system SHALL automatically fallback to basic analysis responses
4. WHEN configuration is invalid THEN the system SHALL provide specific guidance on fixing environment variables
5. WHEN fallback mode is active THEN the system SHALL clearly indicate that basic analysis is being used instead of Azure OpenAI

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want an enhanced chat interface that leverages Azure OpenAI capabilities, so that I can have natural conversations about temperature data and receive expert-level insights.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using the AI chat interface THEN the system SHALL display whether Azure OpenAI or fallback mode is active
2. WHEN Azure OpenAI is processing queries THEN the system SHALL show appropriate loading indicators with Azure OpenAI branding
3. WHEN responses are generated THEN the system SHALL format them clearly with proper markdown rendering and scientific notation
4. WHEN sample questions are provided THEN the system SHALL demonstrate the enhanced capabilities of Azure OpenAI analysis
5. WHEN chat history is maintained THEN the system SHALL preserve the context and quality of Azure OpenAI responses for reference
